 Insights (Hypothetical, but Reasonable):
🔹 1. Missingness Type (MCAR, MAR, MNAR):
MCAR tends to produce more stable probability distributions (lower variance), because the missing data is truly random.

MNAR leads to higher variance, since missingness depends on the value itself → harder to impute confidently.

🔹 2. Imputation Method (KNN vs. RF):
Random Forest (RF) usually gives higher avg probabilities because it's more powerful and picks stronger predictors.

But also sometimes more variable because of its non-linearity and model uncertainty.

🔹 3. Query Type (Selection, Projection, Join):
Selection queries tend to preserve confidence, resulting in higher average probabilities.

Projection and especially Join introduce more uncertainty, lowering the average and increasing the variance — especially if they access correlated attributes.

🔹 4. Model Type (Independent vs. Dependent):
Independent model gives simpler, flatter probabilities (lower variance).

Dependent model respects correlations, leading to:

More concentrated averages (sometimes lower overall)

Higher variance, due to sensitivity to feature interactions

📥 The input query

🧩 Data properties: Missingness type, Imputation method

🧠 Query complexity: evaluated via FIND-PLAN

🧮 Model used: Independent or Dependent

📊 Output statistics: average and variance of result probabilities

🔍 Insights from the Examples:
✅ Example 1 (SAFE – Independent):
Selection query with KNN + MCAR

Output avg is moderate (0.609), variance is low → stable prediction

✅ Example 2 (SAFE – Independent):
Projection on independent attribute (Neighborhood), RF + MAR

Output is confident and stable → good for visualization or downstream use

❌ Example 3 (UNSAFE – Dependent):
Projection of LotArea filtered by SalePrice → dependency triggers #P-complete

Needs Bayesian modeling → more variance in probabilities

❌ Example 4 (UNSAFE – Dependent):
Join across correlated fields like Neighborhood and SalePrice

Output is stronger avg but needs modeling of joint structure

❌ Example 5 (UNSAFE – Dependent):
UCQ-style logic on two features, including price

Lots of variance → this is why independent model would fail
