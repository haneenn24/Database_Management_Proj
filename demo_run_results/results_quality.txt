Great question, Haneen! Let's focus on evaluating **result quality** in the **House Prices probabilistic database** — both in a meaningful **demo setup** and **hypothetical analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Goal: How “Good” Is the Query Output?

We’ll measure result quality by evaluating:

### ✅ 1. **Probability Confidence**
> Are the output probabilities strong and clear (close to 0 or 1), or ambiguous (around 0.5)?

**Metric:**  
- Average **posterior probability**
- Standard deviation (spread)

**Interpretation:**
- High mean + low std → **confident result**
- Mid mean + high std → **ambiguous**

---

### ✅ 2. **Consistency Across Possible Worlds**
> Does the query return **similar answers in multiple worlds**, or does it vary a lot?

**Metric:**  
- **Jaccard similarity** between results across sampled possible worlds
- **Variance of aggregate stats** (e.g., mean `SalePrice`)

**Interpretation:**
- Low variance + high similarity → **stable result**
- High variation → sensitive to preprocessing choices

---

### ✅ 3. **Model Agreement (Indep. vs. Dependent)**
> Do independent and dependent models agree?

**Metric:**  
- **KL-Divergence** or **cosine similarity** between result distributions

**Interpretation:**
- Low divergence → safe to use simple model
- High divergence → dependency modeling needed

---

### ✅ 4. **Query Type Sensitivity**
> Do projection or joins cause unexpected uncertainty?

**Demo:**  
Run the same query under:
- `Selection` vs `Projection`
- On correlated attributes (e.g., `LotArea`, `SalePrice`)
- Compare probability shift

---

## 🧪 Demo Setup (House Prices)

Let’s say:

### Query:
```sql
SELECT Neighborhood FROM house_prices WHERE SalePrice < 200000
```

We’ll:
1. Run it on 4 possible worlds (from different imputations)
2. Get:
   - Avg probability
   - Std dev
   - Jaccard overlap of result sets
   - KL-divergence between dependent & independent model

---

House pricing results:
SELECT Neighborhood FROM house_prices WHERE SalePrice < 200000
across 4 possible worlds (using different imputations).

📊 Interpreting the Result:
Avg Posterior Prob: ~0.37
→ On average, tuples are not very confident — the event isn't dominant across worlds.

Posterior Std Dev: ~0.18
→ Fairly high variance → some neighborhoods are very uncertain across worlds.

Avg Jaccard Similarity: ~0.48
→ Only about 50% overlap across result sets → worlds return different neighborhoods.

KL Divergence (Ind vs Dep): 0.1218
→ Moderate disagreement between models → some dependency needs to be modeled.

radar all DB 
radar chart comparison showing how 4 queries (Q1–Q4) perform across 5 different datasets (House Prices, Air Quality, Lending Club, Diabetes, EHR) based on:

Average Probability

Variance (StdDev)

Consistency (Jaccard Similarity)

Model Divergence (KL-Divergence)

📊 Key Takeaways:
EHR often has higher KL and StdDev → very complex dependencies and noise.

Lending Club and Air Quality are moderately variable → real-world structured, noisy data.

House Prices and Diabetes are more stable and confident, with higher AvgProb.

Queries like Q3 show low confidence and high variance — these may target dependent, sparse, or sensitive features.


🏆 Which Dataset Has the Best Quality?
Let’s break it down by metric:

Metric	Best If...	Best Dataset	Why?
Avg Prob	Higher	Lending Club	Strong, confident results (avg > 0.45)
Std Dev	Lower	House Prices	Lowest uncertainty in result probs
Jaccard	Higher	Lending Club / Diabetes	More consistent across possible worlds
KL Divergence	Lower	House Prices	Independent and dependent models agree
🧠 So Who Wins Overall?
🏅 House Prices has:

Low variance ✅

Low KL ✅

Reasonable AvgProb ✅
→ Very stable and predictable, great for simple models.

🏅 Lending Club has:

High AvgProb ✅

Good Jaccard ✅
→ Great when you're targeting confident, rich decisions (like loans).
