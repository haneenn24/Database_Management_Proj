📊 Stages Explained:
Query Eval – Just reading/parsing the query.

Find-Plan – Safety check using FIND-PLAN(q).

Independent Model – Fast, uses simple probability multiplication.

Dependent Model – Slow, requires conditional inference (e.g., Bayesian network).

🔍 Why the Trends Make Sense:
EHR has the highest total time: it’s the richest dataset with many interdependent attributes → dependent modeling is expensive.

Lending Club and Air Quality also have high dependent costs → strong attribute correlations.

House Prices and Diabetes are moderate — they have dependencies but fewer and simpler than EHR.

Find-Plan is always fast (but not free), increasing slightly with DB complexity
