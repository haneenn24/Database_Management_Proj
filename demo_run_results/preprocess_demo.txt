Preprocessing:

1.add missing data:
‚úÖ MCAR successfully applied to LotFrontage. About 20% of values were randomly removed, simulating Missing Completely At Random.
‚úÖ MAR applied successfully: Missingness in LotFrontage now depends on the value of LotArea ‚Äî we removed values only from rows with LotArea above the median.
‚úÖ MNAR completed: LotFrontage values were removed only from rows where the value was higher than the median ‚Äî this simulates self-dependent missingness.

2.Apply KNN:
‚úÖ KNN Imputation Completed (on MCAR version of LotFrontage)

Method	Description	Output
KNN Fixed	Single imputed value for each missing cell	‚úÖ DataFrame with no missing values
KNN Top-k	Top-k predictions for each missing cell + probabilities	‚úÖ Dictionary with sampled options


## üîç  **Top-k KNN Imputation ‚Äì Example Output**

Suppose we have missing values in the `LotFrontage` column for 2 rows in the dataset (index 12 and 45).  
Using KNN (k=5, top_k=3), the imputer looks at the 5 nearest neighbors and returns the most frequent values among them.

### üß™ Output Structure:

```python
{
  (12, 'LotFrontage'): [(70.0, 0.5), (65.0, 0.3), (60.0, 0.2)],
  (45, 'LotFrontage'): [(80.0, 0.6), (85.0, 0.25), (75.0, 0.15)]
}
```

‚úÖ This means:
- For index 12, the most likely imputed value is **70.0** with 50% confidence.
- For index 45, **80.0** is most likely, followed by 85.0 and 75.0.

These probabilities are **empirical** based on neighbor value frequencies.


3.Apply Random Forest:
## üîç **Top-k Random Forest Imputation ‚Äì Example Output**

Now suppose we're using a trained **Random Forest model** to impute the same column. Instead of relying on neighbor frequencies, we:
- Predict with **each decision tree** in the forest.
- Aggregate the predictions.
- Return top-k most frequent predicted values.

### üß™ Output Structure:

```python
{
  (12, 'LotFrontage'): [(72.0, 0.4), (68.0, 0.35), (65.0, 0.25)],
  (45, 'LotFrontage'): [(78.0, 0.5), (76.0, 0.3), (74.0, 0.2)]
}
```

‚úÖ This means:
- For index 12, **40% of the trees** predicted 72.0.
- For index 45, **50% of trees** predicted 78.0.

These values and probabilities come from **voting across trees** in the forest.

4.assign probabilities

Uniform/Bayesian

Possible Worlds:
Possible World 1 RF+Uniform:
üîÅ Top-k RF Imputation ‚Äî each missing value in LotFrontage was sampled based on RF-predicted probabilities.
üé≤ Uniform Tuple Probabilities (0.8) ‚Äî each row had an 80% chance to be included in the world.



### üî¢ **By Imputation Method and Tuple Probability**

| ID | Imputation           | Tuple Prob Type | World Type |
|----|----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1  | RF (Fixed Value)     | Uniform          | Deterministic + uniform inclusion |
| 2  | RF (Top-k)           | Uniform          | Probabilistic values + uniform inclusion |
| 3  | KNN (Fixed Value)    | Uniform          | Deterministic + uniform inclusion |
| 4  | KNN (Top-k)          | Uniform          | Probabilistic values + uniform inclusion |
| 5  | RF (Fixed Value)     | Bayesian         | Deterministic + Bayesian inclusion |
| 6  | RF (Top-k)           | Bayesian         | Probabilistic values + Bayesian inclusion |
| 7  | KNN (Fixed Value)    | Bayesian         | Deterministic + Bayesian inclusion |
| 8  | KNN (Top-k)          | Bayesian         | Probabilistic values + Bayesian inclusion |

üß† Why These Runtimes Make Sense (Hypothetical Explanation):
Each runtime is influenced by two components:

üîπ 1. Imputation Type:
Fixed Value Imputation (KNN/RF) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Faster

Only one prediction per missing value

No probability calculations

Top-k Imputation ‚Üí ‚è±Ô∏è Slower

Must find multiple candidates and compute normalized probabilities

In Random Forest: collect predictions from all trees

In KNN: compute frequency distributions over neighbor values

üîπ 2. Tuple Probability Assignment:
Uniform Probability ‚Üí ‚ö° Fastest

Just assign a constant (e.g., 0.8) to all tuples

Bayesian Probability ‚Üí üßÆ Slower

üî¢ Summary Table of Expectations
Component	Why It Takes Time
RF vs KNN	RF trains a model with many trees
Top-k	Gathers and ranks multiple predictions
Bayesian	Involves group-wise stats and Bayes rule
So:

üîπ KNN-Fixed + Uniform = fastest

üîπ RF-TopK + Bayesian = slowest


---------------------------------------
‚úÖ Final Suggested Mix (for Diversity + Insight)
Domain	Dataset	Focus
üè• Health	Diabetes Indicators	Categorical + imputation impact on diagnosis
üåé Environment	Air Quality	Sensor uncertainty, MNAR, temporal patterns
üí∞ Finance	Lending Club Loan	Rich MAR/MNAR, great for modeling risk + fairness


Why Runtimes Differ Across Datasets
Dataset	Characteristics	Why Preprocessing Time Differs
Diabetes	Mostly categorical, small to medium size	Fast for KNN, moderate for RF; Bayesian is quick (few unique event groups)
Air Quality	High dimensional, time series, many missing entries (MNAR)	Slower for KNN & RF top-k; Bayesian needs more group stats; imputation over time-sensitive data
Lending Club	Mixed data types, large and sparse	Moderate for all; Bayesian more complex (more event classes); RF builds large trees
House Prices	Medium dataset with rich numerical data	Balanced; RF top-k and Bayesian slightly slower
‚è±Ô∏è General Runtime Expectations:
RF > KNN (RF has model training)

Top-k > Fixed (more computation per cell)

Bayesian > Uniform (needs evidence aggregation, likelihoods)

Elaboration: Comparative Runtime Per Possible World Across Datasets
This chart presents the hypothetical preprocessing time for generating each of the 8 possible worlds across four different datasets: Diabetes, Air Quality, Lending Club, and House Prices.

Each world represents a unique combination of:

Imputation method: Random Forest (RF) or KNN, using either fixed value or top-k prediction.

Tuple probability: Assigned either as a uniform value or derived via Bayesian inference.

üîç Key Observations:
Air Quality consistently has the highest runtimes, especially for RF Top-k and Bayesian configurations. This is expected due to its larger size, higher dimensionality, and greater missingness complexity (e.g., MNAR).

Diabetes is the fastest dataset, due to fewer rows and mostly categorical features, which reduce both imputation and Bayesian computation time.

Top-k methods take longer than fixed-value methods, as they require calculating and normalizing distributions rather than a single prediction.

Bayesian probability assignment adds additional cost, since it involves grouping, likelihood estimation, and posterior calculations.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
The runtime trends align with expectations: larger, more complex, or noisier datasets, and more probabilistic methods, naturally lead to longer preprocessing times. This comparison helps in selecting appropriate pipelines based on dataset characteristics and performance trade-offs.
