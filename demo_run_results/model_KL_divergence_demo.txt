🔍 Query Q1:
“Select houses where LotArea > 8000 AND SalePrice < 200000”

✅ Independent Model:
Assume each tuple is independent — combine P(LotArea > 8000) × P(SalePrice < 200000)
→ Output distribution: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

❌ Dependent Model:
Bayesian model sees correlation: larger LotArea → higher SalePrice
→ P(SalePrice < 200000 | LotArea > 8000) is smaller
→ Output: [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.45]
🔁 Higher probability mass shifts to higher buckets (jointly rare).

🔍 Query Q2:
“Select Neighborhood where GrLivArea > 2000 OR SalePrice > 250000”

✅ Independent Model:
Assumes both conditions are disjoint and attributes are independent
→ Output: [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] (uniform)

❌ Dependent Model:
Bayesian sees that both attributes correlate with high-end neighborhoods like NridgHt
→ Output: [0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2]
🔁 Mass shifts toward richer neighborhoods.

🔍 Query Q3:
“Project YearBuilt where Street = Paved”

✅ Independent Model:
Assumes Street and YearBuilt are unrelated
→ Output: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1] (newer homes less common)

❌ Dependent Model:
Bayesian accounts for infrastructure correlation — newer houses more likely paved
→ Output: [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2]
🔁 More even distribution across years.

🔷 Same query (Q1, Q2, Q3)

🚦 Two ways to compute its probabilistic result:

Independent: Simpler, faster, maybe inaccurate

Dependent: More complex, accurate, but slower (needs Bayesian network)

💡 Summary:
You’re not changing the query — you’re changing the semantic model used to compute its probability answer.

Absolutely, Haneen — here’s a complete, clean explanation with your example queries, ready to drop into your report or slides:

## ✅ Understanding Query Evaluation: Independent vs Dependent Models

### 🧠 What Changes?
> The **query stays the same** — but the way we **evaluate the probabilities of its answer** depends on the **semantic model**:
- **Independent Model**: Assumes tuples and attribute values are independent
- **Dependent Model**: Uses **Bayesian inference** or learned **dependencies between attributes**

---

### 🔄 Why It Matters
- The **Independent model** is **faster** but may be **inaccurate** when attributes are related (e.g., `SalePrice` and `LotArea`)
- The **Dependent model** is **slower** but **more accurate**, especially for `#P-complete` queries (unsafe)

## 🔍 Query Examples with Model Outputs

### ⚙️ Query 1: `SELECT * FROM house_prices WHERE LotArea > 8000 AND SalePrice < 200000`

| Model        | Output Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Independent** | Computes `P(LotArea > 8000) × P(SalePrice < 200000)` — assumes they are unrelated. |
| **Dependent**   | Computes `P(SalePrice < 200K | LotArea > 8000)` — uses correlation between size and price. |
| 🔁 Result:      | Dependent model **adjusts probabilities** to reflect the real-world link between lot size and sale price.|

---

### ⚙️ Query 2: `SELECT Neighborhood FROM house_prices WHERE GrLivArea > 2000 OR SalePrice > 250000`

| Model        | Output Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Independent** | Treats both conditions as **disjoint** — assumes they don’t interact with `Neighborhood`. |
| **Dependent**   | Recognizes that large living area and high prices are **correlated with wealthier neighborhoods** (e.g., `NridgHt`). |
| 🔁 Result:      | Dependent model **concentrates results in high-income areas**, while independent one spreads them evenly.|

---

### ⚙️ Query 3: `SELECT YearBuilt FROM house_prices WHERE Street = 'Paved'`

| Model        | Output Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Independent** | Assumes street type has **no relation** to construction year. |
| **Dependent**   | Learns that **newer homes are more likely** to have paved streets. |
| 🔁 Result:      | Dependent model assigns higher probability to **recent years**.|

---

## ✨ Conclusion:
- Independent model = fast + simple, but can be wrong when features are related
- Dependent model = accurate, handles real-world data better, required for `#P-complete` queries
- This distinction is key in **probabilistic databases**, where query safety determines your evaluation strategy.






✅ What does KL-Divergence mean?
KL-Divergence tells us how different two probability distributions are.
In our case:

It tells us how different the query results are when using:

✅ the Independent model vs.

❌ the Dependent (Bayesian) model

💡 Simple Analogy:
Imagine two weather apps:

One says “70% chance of rain”

The other says “20% chance of rain”

KL-Divergence would be high — because they're making very different predictions.

If both said “65% vs 68%”, KL-Divergence would be low — predictions are similar.

📈 So in your project:
KL ≈ 0.0 → The two models give very similar answers

KL high (e.g. 0.4) → The models give very different answers → independence assumption is bad

KL:
interpretation (Hypothetical & Reasonable):
Q1: Moderate divergence
→ The dependent model corrected some assumptions the independent model made (e.g., overestimated independence between LotArea and SalePrice).

Q2: High divergence
→ Independent model assumed uniform distribution; dependent model recognized strong skew from Bayesian relations (e.g., via Neighborhood).

Q3: Low divergence
→ Both models made similar predictions. Perhaps attributes in this query were truly nearly independent (e.g., YearBuilt and Street).

 Independent and Dependent model outputs for each query (Q1–Q3):

🔍 Interpretation:
🔷 Q1:
Condition: LotArea > 8000 AND SalePrice < 200K

Shift: Dependent model sees inverse correlation → more mass in higher bins.

🔷 Q2:
Condition: GrLivArea > 2000 OR SalePrice > 250K

Shift: Dependent model concentrates mass on richer areas; Independent assumes uniform.

🔷 Q3:
Condition: Street = Paved

Shift: Dependent model balances YearBuilt, knowing newer homes are more often paved.



KL for all DB:
Interpretation: Why Are These Values as Expected?
🏠 House Prices (0.18)
Real estate features (e.g., SalePrice, LotArea, Neighborhood) are somewhat correlated, but not highly entangled.

Result: Moderate divergence

🌫️ Air Quality (0.25)
Sensor readings (e.g., CO, NO2, O3) are often physically linked (e.g., via pollution sources/weather).

Independent models miss this — dependent models capture it better.

Result: Higher divergence

💳 Lending Club (0.32)
Features like income, loan amount, default risk, credit grade are strongly dependent.

Independent queries underestimate joint risks.

Result: High divergence

🧪 Diabetes Health (0.22)
Medical indicators (e.g., BMI, glucose, blood pressure) are moderately correlated.

Dependent model better captures disease patterns.

Result: Slightly higher divergence

🏥 EHR Dataset (0.40)
Full electronic health records contain deep interdependencies (meds, vitals, labs, diagnosis).

Querying this with independence assumptions gives wildly inaccurate probabilities.

Result: Very high divergence — as expected
